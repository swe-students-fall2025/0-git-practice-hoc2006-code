Tree Algorithm

- What i find interesting about this webstie is how much coorelation a sorting algorithm like the binary tree ot only can be used for in software engineering but also the parallels this sorting msystem has to the basic file repository systems that are navigated using recursion. Ive always been fascinated with trees ever since learning about them in data structures and righ tnnow i am so excited to continue to explore their power in software engineering

- I also enjoyed learning about binary search trees in data structures. 
I used the same website in my class to understand how they work.- Ezra Shapiro
